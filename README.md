I am a second year PhD student in the [Structural Bioinformatics Group](http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/index.html) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk).

My interests include structural bioinformatics, software development and open science. Currently my research involves developing computational methods to predict modulating sites on proteins.
