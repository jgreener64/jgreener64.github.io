- Yuchi Guo, a former Masters project student of mine, interviewed me for a podcast. We talked about science, open source software and what makes a good life. You can find it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZlEAqQblcs), [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dr-joe-greener-a-career-in-research-application/id1818584576?i=1000712737412) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1suMW667cDHQVE4jsfuyf4?si=dW-qlUpfSuGEVJcRjBebrg).
