Quite an important change&#33;</p> <p>Honourable mention goes to Åqvist et al.&#39;s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009261403021687">paper</a> on a neat way to control pressure in MD simulations without calculating the virial.</p> <p>OpenMM doesn&#39;t have virial calculation, and this is why.</p> <h2 id=2005 ><a href="#2005" class=header-anchor >2005</a></h2> <p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/33/7/2302/2401364">&quot;TM-align: a protein structure alignment algorithm based on the TM-score&quot;</a> by Zhang and Skolnick.</p> <p>Methods to compare and align protein structures are essential. TM-align extends the TM-score to provide a metric that is normalised across protein size, runs from 0 to 1, and is sequence independent.</p> <p>I&#39;ve always found the cutoff of ~0.5 for the same fold to be useful, with peaks around 0.4 and 0.6 in distributions of TM-align scores indicating pairs with different and the same fold.</p> <h2 id=2006 ><a href="#2006" class=header-anchor >2006</a></h2> <p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd2199">&quot;How many drug targets are there?&quot;</a> by Overington et al.</p> <p>They propose a consensus number of drug targets for all classes of drugs, reconciling previous estimates that differ by an order of magnitude.</p> <p>This was the result of careful database review and dataset curation.</p> <p>The main takeaways are that there were a small number &#40;324&#41; of drug targets and that more than half of drugs target GPCRs, nuclear receptors and ion channels.</p> <h2 id=2007 ><a href="#2007" class=header-anchor >2007</a></h2> <p><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.146401">&quot;Generalized neural-network representation of high-dimensional potential-energy surfaces&quot;</a> by Behler and Parrinello.</p> <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials &#40;MLIPs&#41; are now the hot topic in computational chemistry. This paper was the first proper attempt at training a neural network on DFT data to obtain a fast, accurate MLIP.</p> <p>Today the models are more elaborate and descriptive, but many of the basic concepts - a sum over atom energies, radial/angular symmetry functions, and smooth cutoffs based on distance - are present in this work.</p> <p>Honourable mention goes to Bussi et al.&#39;s <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/126/1/014101/186581/Canonical-sampling-through-velocity-rescaling">paper</a> &#40;also from Parrinello&#41; on rescaling velocities stochastically to sample the canonical distribution.</p> <h2 id=2008 ><a href="#2008" class=header-anchor >2008</a></h2> <p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja8030533">&quot;Crystal Structure of a Ten-Amino Acid Protein&quot;</a> by Honda et al.</p> <p>This paper finds the crystal structure of CLN025, a more stable variant of the ten amino acid protein chignolin &#40;which had an NMR structure&#41; designed by the same first author.</p> <p>They also see multiple folding/unfolding events in 1 μs of MD simulation.</p> <p>The distinction between a peptide and a protein has always been unclear.

then you get high RMSD structures.</p> <p>This shows how quickly errors propagate when building sequentially and has implications for neural network architectures.</p> <p>Honourable mention goes to Pascanu et al.&#39;s <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/pascanu13">paper</a> on the challenges when training recurrent neural networks and ways to address them.</p> <h2 id=2014 ><a href="#2014" class=header-anchor >2014</a></h2> <p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jz500737m">&quot;Building Force Fields: An Automatic, Systematic, and Reproducible Approach&quot;</a> by Wang et al.</p> <p>They use the ForceBalance method to train water models that fit a variety of experimental properties and QM data.</p> <p>This involves taking the derivative of a thermodynamic average property with respect to the parameters.</p> <p>In the machine learning age we should be able to quickly and reproducibly train whole force fields to match all sorts of properties.</p> <p>Going beyond QM data may become increasingly important for machine learning potentials as they are applied to larger systems.</p> <p>Honourable mention goes to Wang et al.&#39;s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2099">paper</a> &#40;also involving Pande&#41;
