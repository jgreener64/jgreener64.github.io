I am a research fellow (postdoc) in the [Bioinformatics Group](http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/introduction) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) (UCL). The group was based at the [Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk) but has now moved back to UCL. Previously I was a PhD student in the [Structural Bioinformatics Group](http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/index.html) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk).

My interests include protein structures, molecular simulation, software development and open science. Currently my research involves developing computational methods to predict and design protein structures, with a focus on deep learning. I am funded on the [ProCovar](http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/procovar) grant by the ERC. See [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apv5YPM0HqY) for an overview of our work.

- Eight-week placement at Imperial College London (summer 2011) on computational modelling of ionic liquids.
- Member of the open source BioJulia project - wrote the [BioStructures.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/BioStructures.jl) package that deals with parsing and manipulating macromolecular structures. Have also made contributions to the [Biopython](http://biopython.org) project, written the [Molly.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/Molly.jl) package for molecular simulation in Julia and written some [pdb-benchmarks](https://github.com/jgreener64/pdb-benchmarks).
- Lead web developer for the Write on Point project that gives applicants to university the skills to write an effective personal statement.
- Proficient with Python, Julia, UNIX and the Django web-development framework. Some experience with PyTorch, C++, C#, R, Java, JavaScript, SQL and HTML/CSS. Familiar with unit testing, version control, automated builds and Docker.
- Experience with deep learning (CNNs, autoencoders) and other machine learning approaches (SVMs).
- Supervision of two ten-week MSc projects and a ten-week BSc project at Imperial, involving project design and regular meetings with the students.
- Demonstration in undergraduate and graduate computational practicals at Imperial and UCL.
