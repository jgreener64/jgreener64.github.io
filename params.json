Currently my research involves developing computational methods to predict modulating sites on proteins, and testing them in the laboratory.\r\n\r\n![Modulation of adenylate cyclase](images/protein.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Education\r\n\r\n**2014-2016** | *Imperial College London* | PhD candidate in Structural Bioinformatics | Funded by [BBSRC](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/bbsrc-doctoral-training-partnership)\r\n\r\n**2013-2014** | *Imperial College London* | MSc Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology | Distinction and highest mark in class\r\n\r\n**2009-2013** | *Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge* | MSci and BA Hons Natural Sciences (Chemistry) | 2.1 classification in all years\r\n\r\n\r\n# Publications\r\n\r\nGreener JG and Sternberg MJE.

Normal mode analysis was used to model the effect of perturbations at potential allosteric sites and these features were combined in a machine learning approach to predict allosteric pockets. Performance is similar and complementary to existing methods and the website has had submissions from around the world.\r\n- Developed the ExProSE computational procedure to generate ensembles of protein structures from multiple input structures. This method provides good coverage of conformational space and can be used, for example, to predict allosteric sites on proteins and explore protein dynamics.\r\n- Three-month [PIPS](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/skills/investing-doctoral-training/pips/) placement at [benevolent.ai](http://benevolent.ai/), a growing company that uses machine learning approaches to predict drug candidates. My project involved developing an in-house tool as part of the biomedical team for use by drug discoverers.\r\n- Two-term MSci project at the University of Cambridge modelling the chemotactic motions of bacterial populations using a multi-disciplinary computational approach.\r\n- Eight-week placement at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (summer 2013) on virtual screening to re-purpose existing drugs.\r\n- Eight-week placement at Imperial College London (summer 2011) on computational modelling of ionic liquids.\r\n- Member of the open source [BioJulia](http://biojulia.github.io/Bio.jl/) project - wrote the Bio.Structure module that deals with parsing and manipulating macromolecular structures.\r\n- Lead web developer for the AllwriteUCAS project that gives applicants to university the skills to write an effective personal statement.\r\n- Proficient in Python, Julia, UNIX and the Django web-development framework. Some experience with C++, C#, R, Java, JavaScript, SQL and HTML/CSS. Familiar with unit testing, version control, automated builds and Docker.\r\n- Supervision of ten-week MSc project and ten-week BSc project at Imperial, involving project design and regular meetings with the students.\r\n- Demonstrating in undergraduate and graduate computational practicals.\r\n- Gave a talk on my PhD work at the Bioinformatics London Meetup group (April 2016).\r\n- Gave a talk on my PhD work at the [3DSIG](http://bcb.med.usherbrooke.ca/3dsig16/index.php) meeting at ISMB (July 2016).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nEmail: joe.greener13 at imperial.ac.uk\r\n",
